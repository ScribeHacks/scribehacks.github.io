# Working with SASS

## Install SASS
https://sass-lang.org

Install the SASS CLI or another app for Windows, macOS, or Linux. If your Linux distro is not supported, you can usually install the `sassc` library and replace `sass` with `sassc` in commands. Note that some versions of `sassc` may not have a watch option.

## Compiling SASS

Run command `sass --watch ./sass/index.sass ./css/index.css` to compile CSS during development.
