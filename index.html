                <p>At ScribeHacks we want people to make something that will help the future instead of the present or past. While this is open ended, we believe that it will spark creativity in each person to think about the future and write the code for it. We believe that by giving a theme that makes you think about the future, you will better plan and develop for it. Whether you want to make an app that will track the energy being used to a robot that can help people who are suffering, we welcome all ideas and hacks that want to make the future of our world a better place.</p>

            <div class="panel">
                <p>A hackathon is an event where participants use their knowledge and skills to create, develop, design, and pitch a solution to a particular problem over 24 hours. They’re open not just to programmers and engineers, but to anyone who’s interested in working together to find answers to the world’s most pressing problems.</p>

                <p>No matter what your skills are, we can use your help in ScribeHacks to help solve for a better future. We believe that solutions are better when they integrate diverse ways of thinking. There will be many opportunities to learn new skills or ideas at workshops and from the people around you. We’ll also be holding team building events where you can meet new people. Just come eager to learn and share your own knowledge!</p>
